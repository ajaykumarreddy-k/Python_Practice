-- SQL NOTES AND EXAMPLES

-- =================================================================
-- DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE (DDL)
-- =================================================================

-- CREATE TABLE: Defines a new table.
-- The following command creates a 'Student' table with various constraints.
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK(age >= 10),
    gender CHAR(1), -- e.g., 'M', 'F', 'O'
    branch VARCHAR(20),
    Email VARCHAR(40) UNIQUE,
    mobile_number BIGINT UNIQUE, -- Changed to BIGINT for standard phone numbers
    join_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

-- ALTER TABLE: Modifies an existing table structure.

-- Add a new column to the table.
ALTER TABLE Student
ADD address VARCHAR(100); -- Increased size for a more realistic address.

-- Modify an existing column's definition (syntax may vary between SQL dialects, e.g., MySQL vs. PostgreSQL).
-- For example, to change the data type or size.
-- MySQL:
-- ALTER TABLE Student
-- MODIFY COLUMN branch VARCHAR(30);

-- PostgreSQL:
-- ALTER TABLE Student
-- ALTER COLUMN branch TYPE VARCHAR(30);

-- DROP TABLE: Deletes a table and all its data permanently.
-- Be very careful with this command!
-- DROP TABLE Customers;


-- =================================================================
-- DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML)
-- =================================================================

-- INSERT INTO: Adds new rows of data into a table.
INSERT INTO Student (student_id, name, age, gender, branch, email, mobile_number, join_date)
VALUES (77, 'Ajay', 18, 'M', 'CSE', 'ajay122@gmail.com', 1231231234, '2025-01-15');
-- Note: It's good practice to provide a valid date or let the default apply.

-- UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.

-- Update a single row based on a unique identifier.
UPDATE Student
SET age = 21
WHERE student_id = 67;

-- Update multiple rows that match a condition.
UPDATE Student
SET age = 21
WHERE age = 18;

-- Update multiple columns in a single row.
UPDATE Customers
SET country = 'RUSSIA',
    first_name = 'John'
WHERE customer_id = 1;

-- DELETE FROM: Removes rows from a table.

-- Delete specific rows based on a condition.
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE country = 'UK'; -- Deletes all customers from the UK.

-- Delete all rows from a table (the table structure remains).
-- DELETE FROM Customers;


-- =================================================================
-- DATA QUERY LANGUAGE (DQL)
-- =================================================================

-- SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

-- Select all columns from a table.
SELECT * FROM Student;

-- Filtering with WHERE clause.
SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE branch = 'CSE';

SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE age > 17;

-- Using multiple conditions with AND.
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE amount > 300 AND customer_id = 4;

-- ORDER BY: Sorts the result set in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
-- LIMIT: Restricts the number of rows returned.

-- Get the top 3 highest orders.
SELECT * FROM Orders
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 3;

-- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS: Perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.

-- MIN(): Returns the minimum value in a set.
-- Find the minimum age among customers.
SELECT MIN(age) AS SmallestAge
FROM Customers;

-- This query might not be standard on all SQL databases as it mixes aggregate and non-aggregate columns without a GROUP BY.
-- It might only return the first name of one of the customers with the minimum age.
SELECT MIN(age) AS SmallestAge, first_name
FROM Customers
GROUP BY first_name; -- Added GROUP BY for standard SQL, though the original intent might differ.

-- COUNT(): Returns the number of rows.

-- Count all customers.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers;

-- Count customers older than 22.
SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM Customers
WHERE age > 22;

-- Count and alias the result column.
SELECT COUNT(first_name) AS "names" FROM Customers
WHERE age > 22;

-- ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS: Perform calculations on numeric data.
SELECT SUM(amount) FROM Orders; -- Calculates the sum of amounts.
SELECT AVG(amount) FROM Orders; -- Calculates the average amount.
SELECT MIN(amount) FROM Orders; -- Finds the minimum amount.


-- =================================================================
-- PATTERN MATCHING & RANGES
-- =================================================================

-- LIKE OPERATOR: Used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

-- Find orders where the item starts with 'M', sorted by item name.
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE item LIKE 'M%'
ORDER BY item DESC;

-- Find orders where the item contains the letter 'i' anywhere.
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE item LIKE '%i%';

-- The '_' wildcard represents a single character.
-- Find orders where the item is like 'M_us_'. e.g., 'Mouse'
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE item LIKE 'M_us_';

-- BETWEEN OPERATOR: Selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
-- The range is inclusive.
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE amount BETWEEN 100 AND 400;
